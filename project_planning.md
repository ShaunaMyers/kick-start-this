# Project Planning

## Design (FE & BE)
* [Wireframes & Schema](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOXUN0rU=/?invite_link_id=311408058947)

## Design Inspirations (UI)

- [kickstarter.com](https://www.kickstarter.com/discover/categories/technology/apps)
    - I like the spacing, two products across the screen 
    - Simple colors/design (white with green logo)
    - Can thumbs up and thumbs down a product
    - Can see name & description, creator, percentage funded, where creator is located
    - Has remind me button so that you can stay updated about product

    - The spacing of the images & information displaye is nice...no more than 3 containers across
    - Simple details below the images: item name & price
    - Options pop up on each image when user hovers- shopping cart, quick view (which opens modal), & heart (to add to favorites) ** I like this idea of having options pop up to quickly get to the payment form
    - Simple color scheme: white with pink & red
    - Nice nav bar with links, H1, & search field
